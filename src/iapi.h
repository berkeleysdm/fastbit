/**
@file This header file defines an in-memory C API for accessing the
querying functionality of FastBit IBIS implementation.  It is primarily for
in memory data.

@note Following the convension established in capi.h, all functions are in
lower case letters mixed with underscores, and all custom data types are in
camel cases with the first letter capitalized.

@note For functions that return integer error code, 0 always indicate
success, a negative number indicate error, a positive number may also be
returned to carry results, such as in fastbit_get_result_size.

@note For functions that returns pointers, a nil pointer is returned in
case of error.

@note About the name: IAPI was original intended to be "In-memory API".
The word iapi appears to be a Dekota word for "word" or "language".

/** An enum for data types supported by this interface.

    @note Only fixed-size data types are supported.

    @note The two types of bit sequences are used to distinguish the input
    formats of the bit sequences.  The type FastBitDataTypeBitRaw is meant
    for user to pass in a sequence of bits in a byte array, where the most
    significant bit in a byte is considered as appearing earlier in the
    sequence; The type FastBitDataTypeBitCompressed is meant for user to
    passing a sequence of bits represented by class ibis::bitvector.
    Internally, a bit sequence is represented by the class ibis::bitvector.
