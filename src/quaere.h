   @brief FastBit Quaere Interface.

   This is the public interface to a set of functions that performs query
   operations.  It is intended to replace query.h.

/// An abstract query interface.  It provides three key functions,
/// specifying a query, computing the number of hits, and producing a table
/// to represent the selection.  The task of specifying a query is done
/// with the function create.  There are two functions to compute the
/// number of results, roughCount and count, where the function roughCount
/// produce a range to indicate the number of hits is between nmin and
/// nmax, and the function count computes the precise number of hits.
///
/// @warning This is an experimental feature of FastBit.  The current
/// design is very limited and is likely to go through major revisions
/// frequently.  Feel free to express your opinions about the design of
/// this class on the FastBit mailing list fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov.
///
/// @note The word quaere is the latin equivalent of query.  Once the
/// implementation of this class stablizes, we intend to swap the names
/// quaere and query.
