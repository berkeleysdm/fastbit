/// A class to represent the select clause.  It parses a string into a list
/// of arithmetic expressions and aggregation functions.
///
/// The terms in a select clause must be separated by comas ',' and each
/// term may be an arithmetic expression or an aggregation function over an
/// arithmetic expression, e.g., "age, avg(income)" and "temperature,
/// sqrt(vx*vx+vy*vy+vz*vz) as speed, max(duration * speed)".  An
/// arithmetic expression may contain any valid combination of numbers and
/// column names connected with operators +, -, *, /, %, ^, ** and standard
/// functions defined in math.h and having only one or two arguements.
/// A handful of functions requested by various uers have also been added
/// as collection of 1- and 2-argument functions.  These extra 1-argument
/// functions include: IS_ZERO, IS_NONZER, TRUNC (for truncating
/// floating-point values to whole numbers), and INT_FROM_DICT (meant for
/// reporting the integer values representing the categorical values, but
/// implemented as ROUND).  The extra 2-argument functions include: IS_EQL,
/// IS_GTE (>=), IS_LTE (<=).
/// 
/// The supported aggregation functions are:
///
/// - count(*): count the number of rows in each group.
/// - countdistinct(expression): count the number of distinct values
///   computed by the expression.  It is equivalent to SQL expression
///   'count(distinct expression)'.  It can be shorted to
///   distinct(expression).
/// - avg(expression): compute the average of the expression.  Note that
///   the computation is always performed in double-precision
///   floating-point values.  This cause 64-bit integer values to be
///   rounded to 48-bit precision and may produce inaccuracy in the result.
/// - sum(expression): compute the sum of the expression.  This computation
///   is performed as double-precision floating-point values.
/// - max(expression): compute the maximum value of the expression.
/// - min(expression): compute the minimum value of the expression.
/// - median(expression): compute the median of the expression.  Note that
///   if the arithmetic expression is a simple column name, the value
///   retuned by this function has the same type as the column.  In cases
///   that require the computation of the average of two values, the average is
///   computed using the arithmetic in the type of the column.  This means
///   the median of a set of integers is always an integer, which can be
///   slightly different from what one might expect.  Arithmetic
///   expressions are evaluated in double-precision arithmetic, their
///   median values will also be double-precision floating-point numbers.
/// - var(expression): compute the sample variance, i.e., the sum of
///   squared differences from the mean divided by the number of rows in
///   the group minus 1.  This function name may also appears as varsamp or
///   variance.  This computation is performed in double precision.
/// - varp(expression): compute the population variance, i.e., the sum of
///   squared differences from the mean divided by the number of rows in
///   the group.  This function name may also appears as varpop because the
///   origianal contributor of this function, Jan, used varpop.   This
///   computation is performed in double precision.
/// - stdev(expression): compute the sample standard deviation, i.e., the
///   square root of the sum of squared differences from the mean divided
///   by the number of rows minus 1.  Thisfunction name may also appears as
///   stdsamp or stddev.  This computation is performed in double precision.
/// - stdevp(expression): compute the population standard deviation, i.e.,
///   the square root of the sum of squared differences from the mean
///   divided by the number of rows.  This function name may also appears
///   as stdpop.  This computation is performed in double precision.
/// - group_concat(expression): concatenate all values of the given
///   expression in the string form.
/// - first(expression)/last(expression): return the first/last (one) row
///   of the given expression.  Note that the aggregation function first
///   and last return the value with the same type as the expression is the
///   expression is a column name.  When an arithmatic expressions is given
///   as the argument to this function, it will return a double precision
///   value because all arithmatic expressions are evaluated in double
///   precision inside FastBit.
///
/// Each term may optionally be followed by an alias for the term.  The
/// alias must be a valid SQL name.  The alias may optionally be preceded
/// by the keyword 'AS'.  The aliases can be used in the other part of the
/// query.
///
/// @note All select operations excludes null values!  In most SQL
/// implementations, the function 'count(*)' includes the null values.
/// However, in FastBit, null values are always excluded.  For example, the
/// return value for 'count(*)' in the following two select statements may
/// be different if there are any null values in column A,
/// @code
/// select count(*) from ...;
/// select avg(A), count(*) from ...;
/// @endcode
/// In the first case, the number reported is purely determined by the
/// where clause.  However, in the second case, because the select clause
/// also involves the column A, all of null values of A are excluded,
/// therefore 'count(*)' in the second example may be smaller than that
/// of the first example.
///
/// In cases where an integer-valued column is actually storing unix time
/// stamps, it might be useful to print out the integer values in the usual
/// date/time format.  In this case, the following pseudo-function notation
/// could be used.
/// @code
/// select FORMAT_UNIXTIME_LOCAL(colname, "formatstring") from ...;
/// select FORMAT_UNIXTIME_GMT(colname, "formatstring") from ...;
/// @endcode
/// Note that the format string is passed to @c strftime.  Please refer to the
/// documentation about @c strftime for details about the format.  Please
/// also note that the format string must be quoted, single quotes
/// and double quotes are accepted.
